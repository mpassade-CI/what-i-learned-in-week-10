### Bootstrap

Bootstrap is a framework to help you design websites faster and easier. It includes HTML and CSS based design templates for typography, forms, buttons, tables, navigation, modals, image carousels, etc. It also gives you support for JavaScript plugins.

### Media Query

The @media rule is used in media queries to apply different styles for different media types/devices.

* resolution
